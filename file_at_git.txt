I am file created at Git hub
Before commit any code 
First pull if see any differences in files then commit or stash you changes
if commit your changes then pull the code again to get the conflict changes and to commit again.
instead of doing that stash your code and pull the code if conflict occurs do the confict resolve and commit.  It is one go commit.
